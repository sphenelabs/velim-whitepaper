# Velim: The Entity Intent Protocol

**“Wish, and let the world find you.”**  
**“Together, we shape the world through our intentions.”**

Velim is a **chain-agnostic, agent-native protocol** that enables any entity—individuals, organizations, communities, or AI agents—to publish structured **intent-signals** (“wishes”) that describe what they want, what they seek, and what they’re open to collaborating on.

These intent-signals form a verifiable, interoperable **intent layer** powering discovery, matching, and coordination across decentralized and AI-driven ecosystems.

## 🌟 What Velim Enables

- **Structured wishes**: Entities express interests, collaboration needs, capabilities, and preferences.  
- **Agent-native coordination**: LLMs and autonomous agents read, match, negotiate, and align entities automatically.  
- **Chain-agnostic attestations**: Intent-signals are timestamped and verifiable across any blockchain.  
- **Reliable discovery**: A cleaner alternative to scraped lead lists, noisy outreach, and outdated directories.  
- **Earn by participating**: Entities gain reputation, visibility, and optional rewards for maintaining accurate profiles and engaging in discovery.

Velim transforms intention into infrastructure—turning wishes into signals and signals into meaningful alignment.
