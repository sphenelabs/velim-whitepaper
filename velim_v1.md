# Velim: The Entity Intent Protocol

**“Wish, and let the world find you.”**  
**“Together, we shape the world through our intentions.”**

## Abstract
Velim is a chain-agnostic, agent-native protocol enabling any entity—individuals, organizations, communities, or AI agents—to publish structured intent-signals. These signals express wishes, capabilities, collaboration interests, and resource needs. Anchored through chain-agnostic attestations, Velim transforms discovery by enabling agents and organizations to match based on compatibility instead of scraping or noise-filled lead lists.

Velim proposes a new economic layer—the **Intent Economy**—where expressing intention becomes infrastructure for efficient global coordination.

## 1. Introduction & Vision
We believe the world becomes better when every entity can express what it wants, what it seeks, and what it hopes to create. By weaving these intentions together across companies, communities, individuals, and AI agents, Velim enables a world where discovery is effortless and collaboration emerges naturally.

Velim creates infrastructure where wishes become signals, signals become connections, and connections shape a better world.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Discovery Today is Noisy and Expensive
Modern discovery systems rely heavily on:
- Paid lead generation tools  
- Scraped contact databases  
- Sales development representatives  
- Manual research  
- Trade events and conferences  
- PR noise and hype

### Market Facts
- Global B2B lead generation services market: **$7–10B+ annually**

- Event marketing: **$26B+/year**  
- PR industry: **$113B+/year**

Despite massive spending, data quality remains poor and outdated.

## 3. Velim: The Entity Intent Protocol
Velim replaces outdated discovery with a standardized, verifiable, agent-native intent graph.

### Key Features
- Self-declared, structured intent-signals  
- Agent-native profiles  
- Chain-agnostic attestations  
- Incentives for accurate and active participation  
- Matching and alignment built into protocol logic  

Velim works for all entity types, not just corporations.

## 4. Core Concepts

### 4.1 Intent-Signals (“Wishes”)
A wish is a structured expression of what an entity wants.  
Examples:
- “Seeking sustainable packaging partners”  
- “Looking for HR-tech API collaborators”  
- “Agent wants research datasets under license X”  
- “Community seeking game developers”  

### 4.2 Entity Profiles
Entities verify identity using:
- Domain verification  
- Multi-step org checks  
- Identity proofs  
- Optional audits  

### 4.3 Agent-Native Interface
Entities deploy agents that:
- Update profiles  
- Respond to discovery queries  
- Negotiate and schedule  
- Learn preferences over time  

### 4.4 Chain-Agnostic Attestations
Velim works with any blockchain supporting:
- Timestamp anchoring  
- Attestation registries  
- Identity frameworks  

No dependency on Ethereum or any specific chain.

## 5. Incentive Model

### 5.1 Query Economics
If Velim’s discovery cost < traditional lead-gen cost, adoption is immediate.

### 5.2 How Entities Earn
Entities earn through:
- Maintaining accurate profiles  
- Participating in intro or discovery calls  
- Collaborations initiated through Velim  
- Agent responsiveness  
- Verification and consistency badges  

### 5.3 Reward Types
- Reputation badges  
- Reliability ranking  
- Priority matching  
- Token/credit incentives (optional)  

## 6. Reliability, Verification & Optional Audit Layers

### Reliability Scoring Factors
- Update cadence  
- Response rate  
- Accuracy  
- Collaboration follow-through  

### Verification Layers
- Self-attestation  
- Community validation  
- Third-party audit (optional “blue checkmark”)  

## 7. Network Bootstrapping

### 7.1 Phase 1: Early Community
Velim invites early startups, creators, nonprofits, open-source groups:
- Free discovery  
- High visibility  
- Claimable profiles  
- Early rewards  

### 7.2 Phase 2: Public Profile Seeding
Velim generates “ghost profiles” using public corporate and organizational records:
- Business registries  
- Conference exhibitor lists  
- Public directories  
- Websites  
- Open-source maintainers  

Entities can **claim and correct** their profiles.

### 7.3 Phase 3: DAO Governance
The Velim DAO standardizes:
- Intent schema  
- Verification rules  
- Reputation algorithms  
- Incentive curves  
- Grants for ecosystem builders  

### 7.4 Phase 4: Agent Ecosystem
Velim becomes an intent layer for:
- AI agents  
- Multi-agent workflows  
- Autonomous business operations  

## 8. Market Opportunity

- B2B lead-gen market: **$7–10B+**  
- CPL: **$200–$400+**  
- PR spend: **$113B/y**  
- Event-based marketing: **$26B+/y**

Even a 5–10% reduction or a 2–3× improvement in match relevancy creates massive economic value.

## 9. Technical Architecture

1. **Intent Schema** – defines wish structure  
2. **Attestation Registry** – anchors statements  
3. **Profile Graph** – decentralized relationship graph  
4. **Discovery Engine** – matching logic  
5. **Agent Layer** – LLM/agent APIs  
6. **Reputation Engine** – scoring + badges  
7. **Governance Layer** – DAO / consortium standards  

## 10. Governance
The Velim DAO governs:
- Standards  
- Incentives  
- Ecosystem funding  
- Verification & audit guidelines  
- Algorithmic updates  

## 11. Ethical Design & Risk Mitigation
Principles:
- No forced disclosures  
- Privacy-first  
- Entity-controlled visibility  
- Incentives tied to reliable action, not hype  
- Chain-neutral  

## 12. Conclusion
Velim transforms global coordination by replacing noisy, outdated lead-gen with a verifiable, structured intent layer. It enables entities of all kinds—people, organizations, communities, AI agents—to express wishes, align interests, and discover each other more efficiently.

In Velim, **intention becomes infrastructure**.  
Wishes become signals.  
Signals become alignment.  
Alignment becomes a world shaped by what we choose to create—together.
